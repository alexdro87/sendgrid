Sendgrid Python wrapper

Quick wrapper around sendgrid API for sending emails for use in moorspots. The idea is to keep the the api interface naming
abstract so we can easily swap out the module for a different email vendor.

Future revisions will also include asyncio handlers to allow me to use it in the API backend
